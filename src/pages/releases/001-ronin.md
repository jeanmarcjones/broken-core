Ronin is a London-based audio/visual artist, underground media magnate, catalyst for hire and general trouble-maker who
has a slightly schizo take on modern electronic dance music.

His musical tastes range across the board and this is reflected in his own output that artfully blends sounds, rhythms
and emotions from a number of different genres into one fierce melting pot.

This release moves away from his familiar hardcore/tekno sound, towards a tearout drum and bass style with Ronins acid
and techno influences coming through heavily, resulting in an eclectic EP we are proud to present as Broken core's first
digital album.
